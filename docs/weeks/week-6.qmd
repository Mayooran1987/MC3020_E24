## Practice

1.  A discrete random variable X taking values 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 has probability mass function given by

    |           |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
    |-----------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
    | X = x     | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   |
    | P (X = x) | 3k  | 2k  | k   | 0   | 2k  | 4k  | 6k  |

    for some constant k.

    a)  Find the value of k.
    b)  Calculate P (X \> 1).
    c)  Calculate E(X).
    d)  Calculate the variance of X.
    e)  Find the variance of the random variable Y = 9 − 2X

2.  A large company has an inspection system for the batches of small compressors purchased from vendors. A batch typically contains 15 compressors. In the inspection system, a random sample of 5 is selected and all are tested. Suppose there are 3 faulty compressors in the batch of 15.

    a)  What is the probability that for a given sample there will be 1 faulty compressor?
    b)  What is the probability that the inspection will reveal more than one faulty compressor in the sample?

3.  The current (in mA) measured in a piece of copper wire follows a uniform distribution over the interval \[0, 25\].

    a)  Write the probability density function (pdf) f(x).
    b)  Calculate the mean and variance.

4.  The time intervals (in minutes) between successive barges passing a certain point on a busy waterway are modeled by an exponential distribution with mean of 8 minutes.

    a)  Find is the probability that the time interval between two successive barges is less than 5 minutes?
    b)  Find a time t such that we can be 95% sure that the time interval between two successive barges will be greater than t.

5.  A lawyer commutes daily from his suburban home to his midtown office. The average time for a one-way trip is 24 minutes, with a standard deviation of 3.8 minutes. Assume the distribution of trip times to be normally distributed.

    a)  What is the probability that a trip will take at least 1/2 hour?

    b)  If the office opens at 9:00 A.M. and the lawyer leaves his house at 8:45 A.M. daily, what percentage of the time is he late for work?

    c)  If he leaves the house at 8:35 A.M. and coffee is served at the office from 8:50 A.M. until 9:00 A.M., what is the probability that he misses coffee?

    d)  Find the length of time above which we find the slowest 15% of the trips.

    e)  Find the probability that 2 of the next 3 trips will take at least 1/2 hour.
