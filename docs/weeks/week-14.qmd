## Practice

1.  **Investigating Student Engagement in MC3020 Lectures:**  The MC3020 course coordinator at the University of Jaffna is evaluating two teaching methods to address low student engagement during lectures. Method A employs **interactive quizzes**, while Method B utilizes **group discussions**. A random sample of seven students was assigned to Method A, and another seven students were assigned to Method B. The active participation time (minutes per lecture) for each student was recorded as follows:

    **Method A (Interactive Quizzes)**: 8, 12, 13, 9, 3, 10, 8

    **Method B (Group Discussions)**: 10, 8, 12, 15, 6, 8, 11

    Assuming active participation times follow normal distributions in the population and using a 0.05 significance level, address the following:

    (a) Estimate the population mean difference in engagement time (Method A – Method B).

    (b) Test whether the population variances of engagement times are equal.

    (c) Construct a 95% confidence interval for the population mean difference (Method A – Method B).

    (d) Test whether the two methods differ significantly in their effect on student engagement.

    (e) Compare your results from Part (c) (confidence interval) and Part (d) (hypothesis test). Explain how these results are consistent or inconsistent with each other in light of the conclusion about mean differences.

2.  A study was conducted in which two types of engines, A and B, were compared. Gas mileage, in miles per gallon, was measured. Fifty experiments were conducted using engine type A and 75 experiments were done with engine type B. The gasoline used and other conditions were held constant. The average gas mileage was 36 miles per gallon for engine A and 42 miles per gallon for engine B. Find a 96% confidence interval on $\mu_B −\mu_A$, where $\mu_A$ and $\mu_B$ are population mean gas mileages for engines A and B respectively. Assume that the population standard deviations are 6 and 8 for engines A and B, respectively.

3.  A study was conducted by the Department of Zoology at the Virginia Tech to estimate the difference in the amounts of the chemical orthophosphorus measured at two different stations on the James River. Orthophosphorus was measured in milligrams per liter. Fifteen samples were collected from station 1, and 12 samples were obtained from station 2. The 15 samples from station 1 had an average orthophosphorus content of 3.84 milligrams per liter and a standard deviation of 3.07 milligrams per liter, while the 12 samples from station 2 had an average content of 1.49 milligrams per liter and a standard deviation of 0.80 milligram per liter. Find a 95% confidence interval for the difference in the true average orthophosphorus contents at these two stations, assuming that the observations came from normal populations with different variances.

4.  An experiment was performed to compare the abrasive wear of two different laminated materials. Twelve pieces of material 1 were tested by exposing each piece to a machine measuring wear. Ten pieces of material 2 were similarly tested. In each case, the depth of wear was observed. The samples of material 1 gave an average (coded) wear of 85 units with a sample standard deviation of 4, while the samples of material 2 gave an average of 81 with a sample standard deviation of 5. Assume that the populations to be approximately normal with equal variances.

    a)  Construct a 95% confidence interval for the difference in mean wear between Material 1 and Material 2.
    b)  Test, at the 0.05 level of significance, whether the mean wear of Material 1 exceeds that of Material 2 by more than 2 units.

5.  The following data represent the running times of films produced by two motion-picture companies.

    | Company | Time (minutes)          |
    |---------|-------------------------|
    | I       | 103 94 110 87 98        |
    | II      | 97 82 123 92 175 88 118 |

    Assume that the running-time differences are approximately normally distributed with unequal variances.

    a)  Compute a 90% confidence interval for the difference between the average running times of films produced by the two companies.
    b)  Test, at the 0.10 level of significance, the hypothesis that the average running time of Company 2 exceeds that of Company 1 by 10 minutes, against the alternative that the difference is less than 10 minutes.
