## Practice

<!-- ![](/images/asap.jpg){width="87"} -->

1.  The heights of 1000 students are approximately normally distributed with a mean of 174.5 centimetres and a standard deviation of 6.9 centimetres. Suppose 200 random samples of size 25 are drawn from this population and the means are recorded to the nearest tenth of a centimetre. Determine

    a.  the mean and standard deviation of the sampling distribution of $\bar{X}$.

    b.  the number of sample means falling below 172.0 centimeters.

    c.  the number of sample means that fall between 172.5 and 175.8 centimeters inclusive.

2.  A manufacturer of MP3 players conducts a set of comprehensive tests on the electrical functions of its product. All MP3 players must pass all tests before being sold. Out of a random sample of 500 MP3 players, 15 failed one or more tests. Find a 90% confidence interval for the proportion of MP3 players from the population that pass all tests.

3.  The production employees at a food packaging facility have been surveyed to determine the proportion of employees who prefer rotating shifts over fixed shifts. Previous surveys suggest this proportion ranges from 25% to 45%. Facility management wants to construct a 95% confidence interval estimate for the true proportion, with a margin of error no larger than 5%. What sample size should they use for the survey?

## Perform

The mid-semester examination will be held on Monday [***(16/06/2025) from 02:00 pm to 02:50 pm***]{.underline} at Exam Hall 1 and Hall 2 (a detailed group list is given below) of the Faculty. We will provide you with writing materials for answering. Non-authorized documents are strictly prohibited in the exam hall. If it is determined that you have violated any policies during this exam, you will receive a score of zero for this mid-exam, without any exceptions or considerations.

To ensure that the exam runs smoothly, we have arranged the exam halls as follows: 

-   Group 1 (Registration numbers **2023/E/001 to 2023/E/101**) will be in **Exam Hall 1 (First floor, Computer Engineering Department)**  

-   Group 2 (Registration numbers **2023/E/103 to 2022/E/198** and re-attempt students) will be in the **Exam Hall 2** (**2nd floor, Admin Building**). 

Please review all sections thoroughly to ensure you're prepared for the exam! I hope everyone follows the exam policies and cooperates with the exam administration to make the exam run smoothly. 

Good luck with your examinations! 

Thanks,
