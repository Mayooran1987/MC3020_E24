## Practice

<!-- ![](/images/asap.jpg){width="87"} -->

1.  A company produces parts for an engine. Parts specifications suggest that 95% of items meet specifications. The parts are shipped to customers in lots of 100.

    a.  What is the probability that more than two items in a given lot will be defective?
    b.  What is the probability that more than 10 items in a lot will be defective?

2.  The serum cholesterol level X in fourteen-year-old boys has approximately a normal distribution with a mean of 170 and a standard deviation of 30.

    a.  Find the probability that the serum cholesterol level of a randomly chosen fourteen-year-old boy exceeds 230.
    b.  In a middle school, there are 300 fourteen-year-old boys. Find the probability that at least eight boys have a serum cholesterol level that exceeds 230.
